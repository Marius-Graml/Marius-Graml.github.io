    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a research-driven Master's student in <strong>Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence</strong> at the
        Technical University of
        Munich (TUM), with a solid foundation in <strong>machine learning and signal processing</strong>. My academic
        path spans research
        experiences in <strong>Germany, Spain, Australia, and South Korea</strong>, fostering a global
        perspective and scientific maturity. While I am particularly interested in <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
            and Deep Generative Models (DGMs)</strong>, I enjoy
        exploring theoretical foundations and novel architectures across a broad range of machine learning domains.
