            Hi, I’m Marius! 👋
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m a Master’s student in <strong>Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence</strong> at
            <strong>TUM</strong>, passionate about research in <strong>machine learning</strong>,
            <strong>signal processing</strong>, and <strong>computer vision</strong>. Along the way,
            I’ve had the chance to work and study across <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong>,
            <strong>Australia</strong>, and <strong>South Korea</strong>, gaining experience in
            interdisciplinary and multi-institutional projects. I’m especially excited about <strong>Graph Neural Networks</strong> and
            <strong>Deep Generative Models</strong>, but I also enjoy exploring new ideas, whether
            that’s digging into theory or experimenting with novel architectures.
